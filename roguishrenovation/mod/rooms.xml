<!-- Here's the answer. Jack is a knight. Suppose that he is a knight; his statement can be true if both Jack and Jill are knights. However, if he is a knave, then he lies -
and it must follow that a) Jill is a knave and b) he is a knight for him to be lying. However, the fact that Jack is a knave stands in the way of that argument, as he cannot
be both a knight AND a knave. Hence, the statement contradicts itself - he MUST be a knight. -->

<!-- Sigh. The answer here is very simple. Let's take it step by step.

*Consider the below arrangement. For Direction to be SE of two runes, it must occupy position 3.
*For Difference to be NE of Thaumancy and yet NW of Direction, it must occupy position 2.
*Hence by elimination, Pillars must be in position 1.
*For Digging to be E of Pillars, it must be in position 5.
*For Thaumancy to be SW of Difference, it must be in position 4.

<!-- Looking up the answer, eh? This one is a little trickier. Let's take it step by step.

*From Pillars' clue, Pillars must be in position 3 or 5 and Digging in 1 or 3.
*From Difference's clue, Difference must be in 3 or 4 and Thaumancy in 2 or 3.
*From Direction's clue, Direction must be in 2 or 3 and Difference in 3 or 4.
*From Thaumancy's clue, Thaumancy must be in either 2 or 5 and Digging in 1 or 4.
*From Digging's clue, Digging is in 1 or 3 and Direction in 3 or 5.
*For Difference to be SW of both Direction and Thaumancy, it must be in position 4.
*For Direction to be both SE of Digging and NE of Difference, it must be in position 3.
*By elimination, since 4 is already filled, Digging must be at 1.
*From there, both Thaumancy and Pillars can be found.

<!-- Slightly trickier now. Six runes, five clues. Let's see how it goes.

*From Pillars' clue, Pillars must be in position 2 or 3 and Digging in 4 or 5.
*From Difference's clue, Difference must be 4, 5 or 6 and Direction in 1, 2 or 3.
*From Direction's clue, Direction must be in 2, 3, 5 or 6 and Pillars 1, 2, 4 or 5.
*From Thaumancy's clue, Thaumancy must be in either 5 or 6 and Scrutiny in 1 or 2.
*From Digging's clue, Digging is in 1, 2 4 or 5 and Thaumancy in 1, 2, 5 or 6.
*Let's start from Direction. From elimination from the clues, it can only be in positions 2 or 3.
*Pillars is N of Direction. Yet it can only occupy positions 2 and 3. If Direction is in 2, there will be nowhere for Pillars to go.
*Hence, Direction must be in 3 and Pillars in 2.
*Using Pillars' position, Digging must be at 4.
*The only possible position for Scrutiny to be at is at 1.
*Using Scrutiny's position, Thaumancy must be at 5.
*Using Direction's position, Difference is at 6.
