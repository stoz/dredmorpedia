  <insult text="Hi-yah! I'm a witcher!"/>
  <insult text="Hmm...I knew you were that kind of exploration team"/>
  <insult text="Holding B doesn't improve your catch rate"/>

  <insult text="I don't see what's so great about Team Charm"/>
  <insult text="I hope you find a sealed chamber and have no keys"/>
  <insult text="It's nice to go exploring"/>
  <insult text="It's a monster house!"/>
  <insult text="It concerns me not what enemies await us"/>
  <insult text="I've got a good feeling about this drink"/>

  <insult text="I'm not a monster, I'm a hero management technician."/>
  <insult text="I'm happy to be exploring with you"/>

  <insult text="I'm going to go exploring all over again today!"/>
  <insult text="JOOR ZAH FRUL! It isn't working! WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?"/>

  <insult text="My precious merchandise! Catch that thief!"/>
  <insult text="MY FULL SUPPORT IS BEHIND YOU! HAVE CONFIDENCE!"/>
  <insult text="No, we have no jobs for a witcher. Have you tried the next dungeon over?"/>
  <insult text="NO ENEMY IS MY EQUAL"/>
  <insult text="NOOO! WILSOOOON!"/>
  <insult text="No, I'm not going to join your team even if you beat me to a bloody pulp"/>
  <insult text="Now your time is over. You will love me, and nothing else."/>
  <insult text="Our guildmaster is something special, isn't he?"/>
  <insult text="Oops! I dropped the lift key!"/>
  <insult text="Oh my gosh! I'm so embarrassed!"/>
  <insult text="Oh no, my belly's empty"/>
  <insult text="Oh no...I guess I'll just put up a note on the job bulletin board"/>
  <insult text="One more for the adventure log"/>
  <insult text="Pills here!"/>
  <insult text="Please don't spam room-wide moves, I hate that"/>
  <insult text="Please share a drink and allow the flower of conversation to bloom"/>

  <insult text="Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light!"/>
  <insult text="Thank goodness it's Friday."/>
  <insult text="Thank you for joining us. Perhaps we can swap hero-disposal tips."/>
  <insult text="That is a fine pair of eyebrows. May I ask how much you paid for them?"/>
  <insult text="The darkness swells within me"/>
  <insult text="The prey approaches"/>
  <insult text="The only way to truly get rid of one of these is have another eat its soul"/>
  <insult text="The Good...they don't know how close to Evil they really are."/>
  <insult text="The flavours metal adds to human meat don't clash, instead they blend together in fine harmony in this dish"/>
  <insult text="The unique bitterness of this situation brings out a mature flavour to the play of your life"/>
  <insult text="They're adventurers, Francis."/>
  <insult text="This is my home. Please, stay awhile and make pie."/>
  <insult text="This isn't Zero Isle, you know"/>
  <insult text="This is...all a nightmare!"/>
  <insult text="There is no pikablu level"/>
  <insult text="The Grand Master of All Things Bad doesn't exist, and we definitely aren't his minions!"/>
  <insult text="That's right, I'm a wanted criminal. Do you have what it takes to bring me down?"/>
  <insult text="TOO SOON, EXECUTUS! TOO SOON!"/>
  <insult text="UP AND AT 'EM! IT'S MORNING!"/>
  <insult text="Visiting your old friends at the guild, eh?"/>
  <insult text="Wait, don't do it THAT way! That's thoroughly unsanitary!"/>
  <insult text="Where next? I'll follow you wherever you go!"/>
  <insult text="Want to pull sentry duty and earn some money?"/>
  <insult text="Would you like a Gracidea?"/>
  <insult text="Wanted outlaw spotted!"/>
  <insult text="Where's our needlessly complicated mechnical contraption?"/>
  <insult text="We are looking for the milkman. We don't know where he is."/>
  <insult text="We all disappear someday, what matters is what we do with our lives"/>
  <insult text="Welcome to the cafe of hopes and dreams"/>
  <insult text="Well, here's your big-win prize"/>
  <insult text="What a farce..."/>
  <insult text="When are you leaving?"/>
  <insult text="Whoever loses has to wear the yellow scarf, okay?"/>
  <insult text="Why two swords? Does he tend to lose them often?"/>
  <insult text="Why aren't we allowed to evolve?"/>
  <insult text="Why, don't you like fusion cuisine?"/>
  <insult text="Why am I a cat fetus sperm tail?"/>
  <insult text="Will you form an exploration team with me?"/>
  <insult text="Will you take me exploring with you?"/>
  <insult text="Where are we going? Gotta make up your mind!"/>
  <insult text="YES! YES!"/>
  <insult text="Yoom-tah!"/>
  <insult text="Your skin-tight costume and plaited eyebrows make me trust you"/>
  <insult text="Your unique bitterness comes together for a mature flavour"/>
  <insult text="You were right, this eyebrow outlaw is probably just an 'E' rank"/>
  <insult text="You've fallen into my trap!"/>
  <insult text="You didn't imagine I would be impeded by this, did you?"/>
  <insult text="YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT?"/>
  <insult text="You broke my bicycle!"/>
  <insult text="You may dream to be a god...but I will never worship you."/>
  <insult text="You wouldn't hit someone wearing glasses, would you?"/>
  <insult text="You'd better not be trying to steal my husband, tramp."/>
  <insult text="Your logical mind cannot contend with an illogical opponent"/>
  <insult text="Your mother uses forks the wrong way"/>
  <insult text="You're still light-years away from facing Broc- I mean, Dredmor"/>
  <insult text="You're keeping me from my dinner, this is an outrage"/>



  <random text="All eyebrows are mortal. You are an eyebrow. Therefore, you are mortal. Q.E.D."/>
  <random text="Are you SURE you're really in a dungeon and not merely having a very realistic dream that you're in a dungeon?"/>
  <random text="Dang, you forgot to prepare your witcher's potions. Maybe you can harvest some stuff from the monsters around here..."/>
  <random text="Guess they weren't lying when they said there were jobs for witchers here."/>
  <random text="Maybe taking this job off the board wasn't the best of ideas."/>
  <random text="Maybe you should've brought a bigger Treasure Bag..."/>
  <random text="Ninjas are just a fairy tale. They don't exist, and there's definitely not one behind you right now."/>
  <random text="Really, you'd have gotten away with it if not for those danged kids."/>
  <random text="Remember, adventurers. Eat your greens, drink your milk, brush your teeth and stay in Dungeoneering 101 class at 300000 Zorkmids a semester."/>
  <random text="They're probably having dinner back at the guild now."/>
  <random text="This feels like the Battle Subway all over again."/>
  <random text="Wait till the guys back at the guild hear about this!"/>
  <random text="What an amazing pokemon adventure this is turning out to be!"/>
  <random text="What sort of pokemon gym is this, and who in tarnation is the gym leader?"/>
  <random text="Welcome to B-Mart, shopper. Please do not park in the cephalopod parking space if you are not one."/>
  <random text="You're certainly not getting paid enough for this."/>
  <random text="You wonder how your partner is doing without you."/>
  <random text="You feel the tremors of Temporal Tower disintegrating."/>
  <random text="You feel ready to evolve any moment now. Good thing there's no one around to see it happen to you."/>
  <random text="You nearly avoid stepping on a Shroomish."/>
  <random text="You find yourself turning into a pokemon. Best get used to saying your name over and over again."/>
  <random text="You know, you might be trapped in a very realistic nightmare from which you can never awaken. Isn't that a nice thought?"/>
  <random text="Your skill in destruction has increased to 25. Oops, wrong game."/>
  <random text="Your witcher's medallion is vibrating like mad. Well, it's only to be expected."/>
